            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat
            the details.

            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration
            testing, and more.

            <h3>Why Laravel</h3>
            <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>A Progressive Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Scalable Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Community Framework</h4></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="your-first-laravel-project">

          </header>
          <p>
            Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend
            installing Node and NPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:
            <code>composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:
            <code
              >composer global require laravel/installer <br /><br />
              laravel new example-app</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
            <code>
              cd example-app <br /><br />
              php artisan serve
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at <code class="inline"> http://localhost:8000</code>. Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the
            Laravel ecosystem. Of course, you may also want to configure a database.
