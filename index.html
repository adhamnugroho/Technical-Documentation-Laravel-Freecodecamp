            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat
            the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration
            testing, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the
            next level. We can't wait to see what you build.
          </p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Why Laravel</h3>
            <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>A Progressive Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Scalable Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Community Framework</h4></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="your-first-laravel-project">
          <header>
            <h2>Your First Laravel Project</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend
            installing Node and NPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:
            <code>composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:
            <code
              >composer global require laravel/installer <br /><br />
              laravel new example-app</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
            <code>
              cd example-app <br /><br />
              php artisan serve
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at <code class="inline">http://localhost:8000</code>. Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the
            Laravel ecosystem. Of course, you may also want to configure a database.

            <h2>Laravel & Docker</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel regardless of your preferred operating system. So, there are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may
            wish to explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using Docker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about
            configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install Docker Desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without
            requiring prior Docker experience.
          </p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On macOs</h3>
            <p>
              If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app",
              you may run the following command in your terminal:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be
              created within the directory you execute the command from.
            </p>
            <p>Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.</p>
            <p>
              After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:
              <code>
                cd example-app <br /><br />
                ./vendor/bin/sail up
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: <code class="inline">http://localhost</code>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On Windows</h3>
            <p>
              Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. WSL allows you to run Linux
              binary executables natively on Windows 10. Information on how to install and enable WSL2 can be found within Microsoft's developer environment documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you are ready to create your first Laravel project. Launch Windows Terminal and begin a new terminal session for your WSL2 Linux operating system. Next, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel
              project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:
              <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be
              created within the directory you execute the command from.
            </p>
            <p>Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.</p>

              <code>
                cd example-app <br /><br />
                ./vendor/bin/sail up
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: <code class="inline">http://localhost</code>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On Linux</h3>
            <p>
              If you're developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app",
              you may run the following command in your terminal:
              <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>

          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Choosing Your Sail Services</h3>
            <p>
              When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the with query string variable to choose which services should be configured in your new application's docker-compose.yml file. Available services include mysql,
              pgsql, mariadb, redis, memcached, meilisearch, minio, selenium, and mailpit:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app?with=mysql,redis" | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>If you do not specify which services you would like configured, a default stack of mysql, redis, meilisearch, mailpit, and selenium will be configured.</p>
            <p>
              You may instruct Sail to install a default Devcontainer by adding the devcontainer parameter to the URL:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app?with=mysql,redis&devcontainer" | bash</code>
