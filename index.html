            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat
            the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration
            testing, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the
            next level. We can't wait to see what you build.
          </p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Why Laravel</h3>
            <p>There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>A Progressive Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Scalable Framework</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A Community Framework</h4></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="your-first-laravel-project">
          <header>
            <h2>Your First Laravel Project</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we recommend
            installing Node and NPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer create-project command:
            <code>composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:
            <code
              >composer global require laravel/installer <br /><br />
              laravel new example-app</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
            <code>
              cd example-app <br /><br />
              php artisan serve
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at <code class="inline">http://localhost:8000</code>. Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the
            Laravel ecosystem. Of course, you may also want to configure a database.

            <h2>Laravel & Docker</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel regardless of your preferred operating system. So, there are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may
            wish to explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using Docker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about
            configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install Docker Desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without
            requiring prior Docker experience.
          </p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On macOs</h3>
            <p>
              If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app",
              you may run the following command in your terminal:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be
              created within the directory you execute the command from.
            </p>
            <p>Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.</p>
            <p>
              After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:
              <code>
                cd example-app <br /><br />
                ./vendor/bin/sail up
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: <code class="inline">http://localhost</code>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On Windows</h3>
            <p>
              Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. WSL allows you to run Linux
              binary executables natively on Windows 10. Information on how to install and enable WSL2 can be found within Microsoft's developer environment documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you are ready to create your first Laravel project. Launch Windows Terminal and begin a new terminal session for your WSL2 Linux operating system. Next, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel
              project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:
              <code>curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be
              created within the directory you execute the command from.
            </p>
            <p>Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.</p>
            <p>
              After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:
              <code>
                cd example-app <br /><br />
                ./vendor/bin/sail up
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: <code class="inline">http://localhost</code>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Getting Started On Linux</h3>
            <p>
              If you're developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app",
              you may run the following command in your terminal:

          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Choosing Your Sail Services</h3>
            <p>
              When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the with query string variable to choose which services should be configured in your new application's docker-compose.yml file. Available services include mysql,
              pgsql, mariadb, redis, memcached, meilisearch, minio, selenium, and mailpit:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app?with=mysql,redis" | bash</code>
            </p>
            <p>If you do not specify which services you would like configured, a default stack of mysql, redis, meilisearch, mailpit, and selenium will be configured.</p>
            <p>
              You may instruct Sail to install a default Devcontainer by adding the devcontainer parameter to the URL:
              <code>curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app?with=mysql,redis&devcontainer" | bash</code>
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="initial-configuration">
          <header>
            <h2>Initial Configuration</h2>
          </header>
          <p>All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.</p>
          <p>
            Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several options such as timezone
            and locale that you may wish to change according to your application.
          </p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Environment Base Configuration</h3>
            <p>
              Since many of Laravel's configuration option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on your local machine or on a production web server, many important configuration values are defined using the .env
              file that exists at the root of your application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your .env file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk
              in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Database And Migration</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you have created your Laravel application, you probably want to store some data in a database. By default, your application's .env configuration file specifies that Laravel will be interacting with a MySQL database
              and will access the database at 127.0.0.1. If you are developing on macOS and need to install MySQL, Postgres, or Redis locally, you may find it convenient to utilize DBngin.
            </p>
            <p>
              YIf you do not want to install MySQL or Postgres on your local machine, you can always use a SQLite database. SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained database engine. To get started, create a SQLite database by creating an
              empty SQLite file. Typically, this file will exist within the database directory of your Laravel application:
              <code>touch database/database.sqlite</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, update your .env configuration file to use Laravel's sqlite database driver. You may remove the other database configuration options:
              <code>
                DB_CONNECTION=sqlite # [tl! add] <br />
                DB_CONNECTION=mysql # [tl! remove] <br />
                DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 # [tl! remove] <br />
                DB_PORT=3306 # [tl! remove] <br />
                DB_DATABASE=laravel # [tl! remove] <br />
                DB_USERNAME=root # [tl! remove] <br />
                DB_PASSWORD= # [tl! remove]
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have configured your SQLite database, you may run your application's database migrations, which will create your application's database tables:
              <code>php artisan migrate</code>
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="next-steps">
          <header>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Now that you have created your Laravel project, you may be wondering what to learn next. First, we strongly recommend becoming familiar with how Laravel works by reading the following documentation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>Request Lifecycle</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Configuration</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Directory Structure</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Front End</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Service Container</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Facades</h4></li>
          </ul>
          <p>How you want to use Laravel will also dictate the next steps on your journey. There are a variety of ways to use Laravel, and we'll explore two primary use cases for the framework below.</p>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Laravel The Full Stack Framework</h3>
            <p>
              Laravel may serve as a full stack framework. By "full stack" framework we mean that you are going to use Laravel to route requests to your application and render your frontend via Blade templates or a single-page application
              hybrid technology like Inertia. This is the most common way to use the Laravel framework, and, in our opinion, the most productive way to use Laravel.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on frontend development, routing, views, or the Eloquent ORM. In addition, you might be interested in learning about community packages like
              Livewire and Inertia. These packages allow you to use Laravel as a full-stack framework while enjoying many of the UI benefits provided by single-page JavaScript applications.
            </p>
            <p>If you are using Laravel as a full stack framework, we also strongly encourage you to learn how to compile your application's CSS and JavaScript using Vite.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="additional-explanation">
            <h3>Laravel The API Backend</h3>
            <p>
              Laravel may also serve as an API backend to a JavaScript single-page application or mobile application. For example, you might use Laravel as an API backend for your Next.js application. In this context, you may use Laravel to
              provide authentication and data storage / retrieval for your application, while also taking advantage of Laravel's powerful services such as queues, emails, notifications, and more.
            </p>
            <p>If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on routing, Laravel Sanctum, and the Eloquent ORM.</p>
